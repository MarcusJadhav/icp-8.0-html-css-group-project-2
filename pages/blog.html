            <p class="product-description">The Glycemic Index is basically a measurement system for foods that contain carbohydrates. <br>
                Carbohydrates are vital as they contain sugars, starches and fibres. Our body converts carbohydrates into glucose (sugar)<br>
                 to provide energy. Glycemic Index denotes how much a particular type of food increases blood sugar levels. <br>
                  The GI has a scale from 0-100 to rank the foods. </p>
